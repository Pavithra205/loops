#A program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. The program should keep asking until the user guesses the correct number using a do-while loop
and a program that checks if a given number is a prime number. The program should keep asking for a number until the user enters a negative number. Use a while
loop to keep asking for numbers and if-else statements to check if the number is prime
